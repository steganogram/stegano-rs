### ‚ú® Features
- **Add WAV Audio media file support - by [sassman], [pull/6]**
  `stegano` has now support for input and output wav audio files (*.wav). This means that hiding secret messages and files are now **not** only possible for png image media files but also wav audio files in the same way. For example like this:

  ```sh
  ‚ùØ stegano hide \
    -i resources/plain/carrier-audio.wav \
    -d resources/secrets/Blah.txt \
       resources/secrets/Blah-2.txt \
    -o secret.wav
  ```

- **Add Arch Linux packages - by [orhun], [pull/10]**
  `stegano` can now be installed from available [AUR packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&SeB=b&K=stegano&outdated=&SB=n&SO=a&PP=50&do_Search=Go) using an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers). For example like this:

  ```sh
  ‚ùØ yay -S stegano
